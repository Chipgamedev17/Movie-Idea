🪵Scene Breakdown
Scene 1: Arrival (0:00–1:00)
Setting: Daytime, Ethan pulls up to a rustic forest cabin.

Montage of him settling in, chopping wood, making a fire, and reading a book.

Everything is peaceful, until sunset.

Scene 2: Dread at Dusk (1:00–2:30)
Setting: Evening inside the cabin.

Ethan hears a distant howl—deep, guttural, unnatural.

He laughs it off, thinking it’s a coyote.

As night falls, noises get louder—scratching at the back wall, something running on the roof.

Scene 3: The Monster Arrives (2:30–4:00)
Setting: Cabin, pitch-black night.

Power goes out. Ethan uses a flashlight.

He looks out the window and sees eyes reflecting in the dark—far apart, too tall to be a normal animal.

It charges the cabin, slamming into the door.

He barely locks it in time.

Scene 4: The Hunt (4:00–6:00)
Ethan hides inside. Something is inside the cabin now—he hears footsteps in the attic.

He finds claw marks in the hallway. His flashlight flickers.

He runs to the bathroom, locks the door, holds his breath.

Silence… then a hand reaches from behind the shower curtain—he stabs it with a broken pipe.

Scene 5: The Final Escape (6:00–7:30)
Bloodied and terrified, Ethan escapes through the window.

He runs into the woods, but the creature follows—tall, pale, emaciated, glowing eyes, long limbs.

Just as it leaps at him—a gunshot rings out.

An old man with a rifle steps forward from the trees:

“Told 'em not to rent that place after dark...”

Scene 6: Aftermath / Twist (7:30–End)
Morning. Police arrive, no sign of a creature—just claw marks and blood.

Ethan gets in the back of an ambulance.

He looks in the rearview mirror.

His eyes flash faintly… glowing.

Cut to black.
